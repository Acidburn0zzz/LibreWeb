1.Convert bad value to a string.
	Sometimes web-pages change, and the output of a tag may change.
	Due to this you can get an error, when trying to convert Value to String.
	LibreWeb will NOT convert a bad numeric value to a string, to avoid error messages.
	Instead, a string will inserted in the spreadsheet cell, as it is on original internet page.
2.Send me an email.
	It is possible to send me an email directly, from menu. To do it, it is neccesary 
	to have installed an email client like Outlook, Thunderbird etc.
3.Some general improvements.

	To do list
1.Working to make LibreWeb more portable.
